# coding-overturn
The Coding Overturn solution is a workspace level solution that provides a report on changes made to a coding decision after second level review. The report displays the original field value, the new value, the user who made the changes, their group access and the timestamp for all documents.

While this is an open source project on the kCura GitHub account, support is only available through through the Relativity developer community. You are welcome to use the code and solution as you see fit within the confines of the license it is released under.
